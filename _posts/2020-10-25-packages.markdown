Software usually has a modular design. The individual features or tools should be independent, separable, and added or removed in different combinations. This means they can also be updated on parallel timelines.

The draw-back is that this modular design creates many *dependencies* between features. A complicated Python program might require a large variety of imported modules, and the code would be dependent on each version used.

This creates the need for package management software:

1. virtualenv and Anaconda

The default python package management tool is virtualenv (). 


conda create --name myenv

2. docker
